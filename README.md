Phase1
Augmented Analytics -- an approach that automates insights using machine learning and natural-language generation, marks the next wave of disruption in the data and analytics market.

However, to go from raw data to insights, you need to go through many technical steps, including:
1) Collect data from multiple sources
2) Clean data so it is ready for analysis
3) Conduct the analysis
4) Generate insights, and
5) Communicate those insights with the organization and convert them into action plans

What augmented analytics does is to relieve a companyâ€™s dependence on data scientists by automating insight generation in a company through the use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.

This project will:

Use Speech to identify data and prepare it.

Use Speech to validate whether it would be useful by using standard statistical tests.

Use Speech to determine kind of report/chart on top of this to further visualize it to enable decision.

We have divided the project in 3 phases:


1) Knowledge Base Creation, SQL generation.


2) Natural Language Processing (TextToSQL) ,Speech to Text conversion.


3) Generate Reports/Charts from SQL created in Part 1.
